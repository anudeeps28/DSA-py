# ðŸŽ¯ Computer Guesses Your Number

This is a **fun Python game** where the **computer tries to guess a number that you think of!** The program uses an efficient **binary search algorithm** to make smart guesses instead of random ones.

---

## ðŸ“œ How the Game Works
1. **You think of a number** between **1 and 100** (or a custom range).
2. The **computer makes a guess**.
3. You provide **feedback**:
   - Enter **'h'** if the guess is **too high**.
   - Enter **'l'** if the guess is **too low**.
   - Enter **'c'** if the guess is **correct**.
4. The computer **adjusts its guesses** based on your feedback.
5. The game continues **until the computer correctly guesses your number**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- ðŸ§  **Smart Guessing:** Uses **binary search** to guess efficiently.
- âš¡ **Fast & Optimized:** Always finds the number in **log(n) time** (e.g., max 7 guesses for 1-100).
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive & Fun:** You control the game by giving feedback.
- ðŸ”¢ **Custom Range:** Modify the `low` and `high` values to change the guessing range.
