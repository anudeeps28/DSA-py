# 🔠 Hangman Game

This is a **classic Python game** where you **guess a hidden word one letter at a time!** The program randomly selects a word and challenges you to reveal it before the hangman drawing is completed.

## 📜 How the Game Works

1. A random word is selected from a predefined list.
2. The word is displayed with underscores representing unguessed letters.
3. You guess one letter at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in all correct positions.
5. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.
6. The game continues until you either guess the full word or the hangman drawing is complete.
7. After each round, you can choose to restart or quit the game.
