# Hangman Game Project Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for developing a Python-based Hangman game. It covers the versioning strategy, environments, key features, system logic & architecture, implementation roadmap, and the technical stack & tools to be used.

---

## 1. Versioning Strategy

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
  - **Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
    - **MAJOR:** Incompatible API or feature changes (e.g., significant refactoring or moving from console to GUI).
    - **MINOR:** New functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner (e.g., additional game modes, scoring, or difficulty levels).
    - **PATCH:** Backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **Release Cycle:**
  - **Alpha Releases:** Early iterations (v0.x.x) for internal testing and rapid feedback.
  - **Beta Releases:** Feature-complete versions (v1.0.x) inviting external testing.
  - **Stable Releases:** Finalized versions once critical bugs are fixed and documentation is complete (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.).
- **Branching Model:**
  - **Main/Master:** Reflects the latest stable release.
  - **Develop:** Integration branch for new features and improvements.
  - **Feature Branches:** Separate branches for each feature or improvement, merged into `develop` after testing.

---

## 2. Environments

- **Development Environment:**
  - Local machines running Python 3.x.
  - Developers use IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) with local virtual environments.
  - Frequent commits to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub) using feature branches.
- **Staging Environment:**
  - Pre-production environment for Quality Assurance (QA) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
  - Automated builds and tests run via CI/CD pipelines.
  - May be implemented as a Docker container or virtual machine mirroring production.
- **Production Environment:**
  - The final release environment where end users download or interact with the game.
  - The application can be packaged (e.g., using PyInstaller) for distribution or hosted as a web/desktop app.
- **Additional Environments (Optional):**
  - **Testing Environment:** For automated unit, integration, and UI tests.
  - **Demo Environment:** Publicly accessible version for showcasing features without impacting production users.

## 3. Key Features

### Primary Features:

- **Core Game Mechanics:**
  - **Random Word Selection:** Choose a random word from a predefined or dynamic list.
  - **Display of the Word:** Show blanks for unguessed letters and reveal correct guesses.
  - **Input Handling & Validation:** Ensure input is a single alphabetic character and avoid duplicate guesses.
  - **Hangman Illustration Progression:** Use ASCII art (for console) or images (for GUI) to represent the hangman’s state.
  - **Win/Loss Conditions:** End game with appropriate messages when the word is guessed or maximum wrong guesses are reached.
  - **Restart/Quit Option:** Prompt the user to restart or quit after game completion.

### Secondary Features:

- **Enhanced User Experience:**
  - **Difficulty Levels:** Adjust word complexity or allowed mistakes.
  - **Hints System:** Provide optional clues for challenging words.
  - **Scoring Mechanism & Leaderboard:** Track scores and display high scores.
- **User Interface Enhancements:**
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a GUI version using Tkinter or Pygame.
  - **Sound Effects:** Integrate audio cues for correct or incorrect guesses.
- **Additional Modes:**
  - **Multiplayer or Networked Play:** Enable competitive or shared leaderboard modes.
  - **Custom Word List Support:** Allow users to import or define their own word sets.

## 4. System Logic & Architecture

### High-Level Architecture:

- **Application Type:**
  - **Monolithic Application:** Suitable for the scope of the Hangman game.
- **Modular Design:**
  - **Game Engine Module:** Handles core game logic, word selection, state management, and the game loop.
  - **User Interface Module:**
    - **Console Mode:** Manages ASCII art rendering and text-based I/O.
    - **GUI Mode:** Manages window management, event handling, and graphical assets (if implemented).
  - **Utility Module:** Provides input validation, file I/O, logging, and configuration management.
  - **Persistence Module (Optional):** For saving high scores or game settings (using SQLite or JSON).

### Data Flow & Business Logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Load configuration and assets.
   - Select a random word from the word list (from a local file, API, or hardcoded list).
2. **Game Loop:**
   - **Input:** User enters a guess.
   - **Validation:** Ensure the guess is valid and not a duplicate.
   - **Processing:** Update game state:
     - Reveal letter positions if the guess is correct.
     - Increment wrong guess counter and update hangman illustration if incorrect.
   - **Output:** Render updated game state to the user interface.
   - **Loop Termination:** Ends when the user wins (all letters revealed) or loses (maximum wrong guesses reached).
3. **Post-Game:**
   - Display final results.
   - Offer replay or exit options.
   - Optionally update persistent data (e.g., scores).

### Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies:

- **Input Validation Issues:**
  - **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive unit tests and clear error messaging.
- **UI Responsiveness (for GUI Version):**
  - **Mitigation:** Use event-driven programming patterns and decouple game logic from UI rendering.
- **Maintaining State Consistency:**
  - **Mitigation:** Use a well-defined state management strategy and encapsulate game logic into testable functions.
- **Scalability for Future Enhancements:**
  - **Mitigation:** Design modular code to facilitate the integration of additional features (e.g., multiplayer mode).

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Week 1)
- Define and document requirements.
- Finalize the feature list and scope (MVP vs. extended features).
- Establish versioning, branching strategy, and initial project structure.
- Set up repository and project management tools (e.g., GitHub, Jira/Trello).

### Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 2–4)
- **Milestone 1:** Develop the core game engine (word selection, game loop, state management).  
  *Timeline:* 1 week
- **Milestone 2:** Build the console-based user interface and integrate it with the game engine.
