# Object Oriented Programming in Python
# Creating a more complex object

# advantege of using multiple classes instead of using one class

course.add_student(s1)
course.add_student(s2)

# prints: [<__main__.Student object at 0x1029fadf0>, <__main__.Student object at 0x1029fad90>]
# means that both our sourses are student objects
print(course.students)

# this prints the name
print(course.students[0].name)
print(course.students[1].age)
print(course.get_average_grade()) #this will print the average of all the grades of s1,s2 and s3

# the idea = we can have different classes with different attributes and we can program them in a different style to interact with them
# thus, we can make classes interact with each other
